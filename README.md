# SHPE @ UIC

Mobile app for the UIC chapter of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers.
Built with Expo (React Native) and Firebase.

Events are **not entered in the app**. Officers add them to the chapter Google
Calendar, and a sync job copies them into Firestore, where the app reads them
live. See [Adding events](#adding-events-for-officers) below.

```
Google Calendar  ──►  sync job  ──►  Firestore  ──►  Expo app
"SHPE @ UIC"          every 30min                    (live, no refresh)
```

## Repo layout

This repo contains **two separate npm packages**. They each have their own
`package.json`, `node_modules`, and `.env` — installing one does not install
the other.

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`frontend/`](frontend/) | The Expo app. This is the actual product. |
| [`backend/`](backend/) | Node scripts: the Google Calendar → Firestore sync. Run on a schedule, not as a always-on server. |
| [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/) | The scheduled sync job. |

Root `package.json` covers `backend/`. `frontend/package.json` covers the app.

---

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node 20 or newer** (developed on 22)
- A phone with [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), or an iOS/Android simulator
- Access to the `shpe-webapp` Firebase project

### 1. Install dependencies

Both trees, separately:

```bash
npm install            # backend
cd frontend
npm install            # the app
```

### 2. Configure the app

Create **`frontend/.env`** — copy [`frontend/example.env`](frontend/example.env)
and fill in the real values from Firebase Console → Project settings → Your apps.

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
```

The **`EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix is required.** Expo ignores any other variable name,
and a misnamed key fails silently — the app starts and then errors on the first
Firestore call. These values are baked into the app bundle, which is expected
for Firebase web config; Firestore rules are what actually protect the data.

### 3. Run it

```bash
cd frontend
npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code with Expo Go, or press `i` / `a` for a simulator.

> **After changing `.env`, always restart with `npx expo start -c`.** Environment
> values are inlined at build time, so a warm cache keeps serving the old ones.

That's everything needed to work on the UI. The sections below are only for
working on the calendar sync.

## Adding events (for officers)

Create the event in the **SHPE @ UIC** Google Calendar. Within 30 minutes it
appears in the app for everyone — no deploy, no app update.

**1. Fill in the event normally.** These fields carry over:

| In Google Calendar | Shows in the app as |
|---|---|
| Title | Event name |
| Date and time | Date badge and time range |
| Location | Location |
| Description | "About This Event" |

**2. Set the event color.** This is the important one — **the color decides the
category and how many points the event is worth.**

| Color | Category | Points |
|---|---|---|
| Blueberry | GBM | 3 |
| Tangerine | Career | 3 |
| Tomato | Career | 3 |
| Basil | Volunteer | 3 |
| Sage | Volunteer | 3 |
| Peacock | Workshop | 2 |
| Banana | Fundraiser | 2 |
| Lavender | Social | 1 |
| Grape | Social | 1 |
| Flamingo | Study | 1 |
| Graphite | Other | 0 |
| *(no color set)* | Event | 1 |

Leaving the color at the calendar default gives you a generic "Event" worth 1
point, so it's worth picking one deliberately.

To change these categories or point values, edit
[`backend/config/eventTags.js`](backend/config/eventTags.js).

### Things worth knowing

- **Editing an event updates the app.** Change the title, time, or location and
  the change syncs on the next run.
- **Deleting an event removes it from the app**, within 30 minutes.
- **Recoloring changes the points.** If someone manually overrode an event's
  points in Firestore, that override survives ordinary edits — but recoloring
  the event resets points to the new color's value.
- **Past events disappear automatically.** The app only lists events that
  haven't ended yet, so there's no cleanup to do.
- **The calendar is public.** Titles, descriptions, and locations are readable
  by anyone with the link, and the sync copies them verbatim into the app. Don't
  put anything internal in the description.
- **All-day events** show as "All Day" rather than a time range.

## The calendar sync

### How it runs

[`.github/workflows/calendar-sync.yml`](.github/workflows/calendar-sync.yml)
runs every 30 minutes on GitHub Actions. Nothing needs to be deployed or kept
awake — the app talks to Firestore directly, so there's no server in the request
path.

To run it by hand: **Actions → Calendar sync → Run workflow.** Tick **full** to
ignore the stored sync token and re-import everything from the last 30 days.

> Scheduled workflows only run from the **default branch**. On a feature branch
> the job won't appear in the Actions tab at all.

### Running it locally

Needs root `.env` (see [`example.env`](example.env)) plus a service account key:

```
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=5181cd695daacda195419f54943289d80830f2df1dc992e614a30c8a34cee147@group.calendar.google.com
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH=./serviceAccountKey.json
```

Get the key from Firebase Console → Project settings → Service accounts →
Generate new private key. Then, one time in Google Cloud Console, enable the
**Google Calendar API** and share the calendar with the key's `client_email`
("See all event details").

```bash
npm run sync          # incremental
npm run sync:full     # re-import from scratch
npm run backend       # Express server, exposes POST /api/sync/calendar
```

Both `.env` files and `serviceAccountKey.json` are gitignored. Never commit them.

### How it works

Google's API returns a **sync token** — pass it back on the next call and you
get only what changed since, including deletions. A run with no calendar
activity is a single API call.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| [`backend/syncOnce.js`](backend/syncOnce.js) | Entry point for the scheduled job |
| [`backend/calendarSync.js`](backend/calendarSync.js) | Sync token state, merge rules |
| [`backend/googleCalendar.js`](backend/googleCalendar.js) | Calendar API + pagination |
| [`backend/eventMapping.js`](backend/eventMapping.js) | Google event → app schema |
| [`backend/config/eventTags.js`](backend/config/eventTags.js) | Color → category → points |

## Data model

`events/{googleCalendarEventId}` in Firestore:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Event title |
| `description` | string | |
| `location` | string | |
| `tag` | string | From the event color |
| `points` | number | From the tag; survives manual override |
| `date` | string | `"01/15/2026"` |
| `startsAt` / `endsAt` | string | `"6:00 PM"`, or `"All Day"` |
| `startAt` / `endAt` | timestamp | Real instants, for future queries |
| `allDay` | boolean | |
| `googleCalendarEventId` | string | |
| `createdAt` / `updatedAt` | timestamp | |

The app reads these through [`frontend/lib/events.ts`](frontend/lib/events.ts),
which exposes two hooks:

- `useUpcomingEvents()` — live list, past events filtered out, soonest first
- `useEvent(id)` — one event, so the detail screen works from a deep link

Both use Firestore's `onSnapshot`, so edits appear without a refresh.

> **Known limitation:** because `date` and `startsAt` are display strings,
> Firestore can't sort or filter them — `useUpcomingEvents` downloads the whole
> collection and filters on the device. Fine at club scale; switch the query to
> the `startAt` timestamp if the collection grows into the thousands.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| App shows "Couldn't load events" | Firestore rules deny reads, or `frontend/.env` is missing/misnamed |
| Firebase config values are `undefined` | Variables not prefixed `EXPO_PUBLIC_`, or Metro cache is stale — `npx expo start -c` |
| Sync reports `created: 0, seen: 0` | No upcoming events on the calendar |
| Sync fails with `403` | Calendar API not enabled, or calendar not shared with the service account |
| `Service account key not found` | `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH` is wrong, or the Actions secret `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` is missing |
| Event added but not in the app | Wait for the next 30-minute run, or trigger one manually; check the event hasn't already ended |
